Hi Amit,

Docs and Hackers aims to promote healthcare innovation by bringing the tech and healthcare communities together, regularly. We have consistently heard feedback that community members would like to form teams and take shots at real world problems. These could be fun projects on the side, and can potentially grow into a startup.

We are excited to announce a new experiement to help you do just that - called Challenges<. In collaboration with payers, providers and other healthcare organizations, we shall curate a list of live challenges. Each with well defined problem statements that are real-world problems.

We currently have 2 challenges live:
1. <a href=\"https://vinaj.com/humana-challenge\">Humana Innovation Challenge – Patient Records for Humans</a>. 

<i>A $10K challenge focused on solutions for Medicare members. We are seeking students, individuals and early stage startups (pre-seed and seed stage) based in California. Traditionally, Humana and other health plans have stored digital health records in categorical databases. Medical claims, pharmacy claims, calls, letters, hospital stays, and health program partcipation are all stored in disparate places. With advanced data processing and analyics, it is now possible to assemble these data sources about a patient’s history into a chronological “story,” with all the different data elements stitched together into a logical time order. Now that the data is organized in a humanly meaningful way, the opportunity is to present the data through a tool simple enough to allow users to make sense of even the most complex chronic history. Feel free to explore use of visual and/or verbal interaction modes in helping users make best use of the data.

Six teams will be selected as finalists and invited to present in-person to a panel of industry experts. Prizes will be given to 1st, 2nd and 3rd place teams.</i>

2. <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/challenges/code-a-thon/index.html\">HHS Opioid Code-a-Thon</a>.

<i>Calling all computer programmers, public health experts, data scientists, researchers, and innovators! We need your help to develop data-driven solutions to combat the opioid epidemic, building on HHS’ five-part strategy. There are three challenge tracks for you to contribute solutions: Treatment Track, Usage Track and Prevention Track. 

About 25 teams will be able to participate due to limited space. We ask that each team is pre-formed and consists of 3-5 individuals.There will be three prize opportunities up to $10,000 each – one for each track.</i>

Check them out, form teams and have a go! Please reach out if you have any questions, feedback and/or need any help.

Ankit.
